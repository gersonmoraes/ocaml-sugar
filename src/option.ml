open S.Params

(**
  An implementation of {{!Sugar.S.Result_partials}  Result } interface
  for the option type.

  This is probably the easiest way to start using Sugar, as there is no need to
  use describe errors. Still, because this module follows the
  same interface, when you need to start refactoring to more complex, monadic
  results you get to keep the same clean interface, making be transition
  straightfoward.

  Usage example:
  {[
    open Sugar.Option

    let do_something (): string result =
      if true then
        Some "you could use any option type"
      else
        throw ()

    let run (): string result =
      do_something ()
      >----------
      ( fun () ->
        return "recovered"
      )
  ]}

  In case you are wondering, the evaluation of [run ()] in the example above,
  will produce: [string option = Some "you could use any option type"].
