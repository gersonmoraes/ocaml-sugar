# OCaml Sugar

A peek into the future of Functional Programming

<small>*Gerson Moraes*</small>

---
class: left, middle

# What it is

A **Model Driven Development** library that allows you to:

- Write code using modern FP techniques
- Produce clean code using error-aware expressions everywhere
- Write DSLs that are modular and composable by design

---

# OCaml lean and clean

**Safer computations**

Exceptions are easy to write and easier to forget. Better to avoid them. Sugar encourages you to define your error types early on, and always be ready for failures.

**One interface to rule them all**

Using meta programming, all our error aware expressions, *asynchronous or not*, will keep the same clean look. Let the machine translate the result types. *Focus on the real stufff*.

---

# Custom-build for your project

Set up an isolated module for your errors.
```ocaml
module MyError = struct
  type t = AlreadyExists | Not_found
end
```
<br/>

And feed it to a *result module builder* to start coding:
```ocaml
module MyResult = Sugar.Result.Make (MyError)
open MyResult

let main () : string result =
  do_something ()
  >>= fun res ->
  run_computation res >>
  return "hello world"

```

---

# Add your error handlers

With exceptions, you'd normally use a `try...with` block like:

```ocaml
let program () =
  try
    do_something ()
  with
  | AlreadyExists -> print_endline "recoverd"
  | Not_found     -> print_endline "recoverd"
```
<br/>

```ocaml
let program () =
  try
    do_something ()
  with
  | AlreadyExists -> print_endline "recoverd"
  | Not_found     -> print_endline "recoverd"
```
<br/>

The same can be done with error aware expressions:

```ocaml
let program () =
  do_something ()
  >---------
  ( function
    | AlreadyExists -> puts "recoverd"
    | Not_found     -> puts "recoverd"
  )
```

Did you see the following expression?

# Not just aesthetics

The **broom** combinator has the *exact minimum char count* for the next expression: *an anonymous function wrapped inside a block*.

The same goes for the other syntax for anonymous functions:

```ocaml
let program () =
  do_something ()
  >---------
  ( fun e ->
    puts "recoverd"
  )
```

# Why this matters

- Anonymous functions have *gigantic scope*.
- Using them to write an alternative control flow can be misleading
- You want a block around every error handler.

# Way more than that

A short path to composable DSLs with the **Free Monad**, no Category Theory required. Don't write a program, write a description of a program. Since it's your description, you can decide how to interpret it, and in how many ways.

**Separate concerns**. Business logic far from cloud services and logging. Tests don't need to change production code: just change interpreters.

# Abstract concepts

**Funtors**, **Monads** and **Free Monads** matter. You should probably learn about them. But this knowledge is not essential to write DSLs, since a basic OCaml undertanding is enough to get you started.

A **Continuation** is a fancy word to name a callback. It is a function stored for later to be run at some point. Each instruction in the language defines a signature for the next continuation, effectively specifying details about valid chains of expressions.

# More on Continuations

**Watching the next instruction**

To write a DSL, you need to describe *(and implement)* each instruction separately. One crucial information about an instruction is what value it should return back to the caller. This is defined by specifying the next continuation in the chain.

To help you do that, use the `next` type:

```ocaml
type ('f, 'args) next = 'args -> 'f
```

<br/>
Can you guess the meaning of each type of continuation bellow?

```ocaml
type 'f instruction =
  | A of ('f, string) next
  | B of ('f, int option) next
  | C of ('f, bool -> bool -> bool) next
```

---
class: left, top

# More on Continuations

**Unrelated continuations**

If your expression doesn't return any useful value, you could use the `unrelated` type alias:

```ocaml
type 'f unrelated = ('f, unit) next
```

<br/>
In the example bellow, `A` and `B` have the same singnature for the next continuation.

```ocaml
type 'f instruction =
  | A of ('f, unit) next
  | B of 'f unrelated
```

# Interfaces for DSL writers

In the next slides, we will describe the minimum steps to create a Dsl: a small language to print and get lines from the screen.

We will go over the main conventions, meta programming, and the few things you need to do so other people can safely use your DSL.

# DSL Writer Tour - Part I

So you want to write a DSL. This is what you need:

- Describe your core instructions
- Write a `map` function
- Specify your errors

---

# DSL Writer Tour - Part I

So you want to write a DSL. This is what you need:

- **Describe your core instructions**
- Write a `map` function
- Specify your errors

<br/>

----

We are defining just two instructions: Puts and GetLine. 

```ocaml
module Terminal = struct

  module Core = struct
    type 'f t
      = Puts of string * ('f unrelated)
      | GetLine of ('f, string result) next
  end

end
```

---

# DSL Writer Tour - Part I

So you want to write a DSL. This is what you need:

- ~~**Describe your core instructions**~~
- **Write a `map` function**
- Specify your errors

<br/>

----

This is how the compiler will know how to store and iterate over instructions on our programs.

```ocaml
module Terminal = struct
  
  module Core = struct
    ...
    
    let map f = function
      | Puts (s, g) -> Puts (s, f @ g)
      | GetLine g -> GetLine (f @ g)
  end

end
```

---

# DSL Writer Tour - Part I

So you want to write a DSL. This is what you need:

- ~~**Describe your core instructions**~~
- ~~**Write a `map` function**~~
- **Specify your errors**

<br/>

----

Don't forget to make your errors serializable using s-expressions.

```ocaml
open Sexplib.Std

module Terminal = struct
  module Core = ... 

  module Errors = struct
    type t
      = Not_available
      | Unexpected of string [@@deriving sexp]
  end

end
```

# DSL Writer Tour - Part II

Simple so far, but we're not done. We will also need:

- Integrate your errors with Sugar
- Create a specification for this DSL
- Write a public module your users

---

# DSL Writer Tour - Part II

Simple so far, but we're not done. We will also need:

- **Integrate your errors with Sugar**
- Create a specification for this DSL
- Write a public module your users

<br/>

----

This will get you an `Error` constructor to wrap around your door specification. It will also add a `string_of_error` function.

```ocaml
module Terminal = struct
  module Core = ...

  module Errors = ...
  include Sugar.DSL.ErrorFor(Errors)
end
```

---

# DSL Writer Tour - Part II

Simple so far, but we're not done. We will also need:

- ~~**Integrate your errors with Sugar**~~
- **Create a specification for this DSL**
- Write a public module your users

<br/>

----

A `Spec` module gives you essential interoperability signatures and builders so your Dsl can became pluggable.

```ocaml
module Terminal = struct
  ...
  
  module Spec = Sugar.DSL.SpecFor(Core)
end
```

end
```

---

# DSL Writer Tour - Part II

**Public Api**

You need a module to work as a public view of your DSL, so other DSL writers or developers writing a final program. To make one, you need to know what is a *context*.

> **Context** is a module responsible for the translation of core instructions from current the language to the bigger language used to build the final runtime. They can be seem as the glue that allows you to mix different DSLs.

><u>Note:</u> The signature for the context matching the current library is given by the `Spec.S.Context`.


---

# DSL Writer Tour - Part II

**Public Api (example)**

Let's finish the specification of our Terminal Dsl.
It uses two helper functions to "instanciate" each instruction:

- **id**: return the next continuation
- **lift**: *store the instruction for later*. This instruction will be "stored" in the Free Monad main type.


```ocaml
module Terminal = struct
  ...

  module Api (Ctx:Spec.S.Context) = struct

    let puts s =
      Puts (s, id) |> Ctx.lift

    let get_line () =
      GetLine id |> Ctx.lift

  end
end
```
